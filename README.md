# Inventory Management System
**Version**: 2.0.0.PHASE3

## Overview
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage product inventories. The system provides functionalities to **insert**, **delete**, **retrieve**, and **sort** products, ensuring smooth operations for maintaining product data. The core logic of the system is built on two key data structures: an **AVL tree** and a **hash table**, both of which help optimize performance for fast lookups, insertions, deletions, and sorting.

## Features
- Fast product lookups using partial or complete IDs
- Price-based range queries and sorting
- Automatic ID generation using UUIDs
- Data consistency across data structures
- Comprehensive input validation
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Extensive error handling

## Project Structure

### `evidences/`
 A directory containing screenshots generated by the testing of the code. 


### `AVLTree.py`
Contains the implementation of the **AVL tree** data structure, which ensures that product data is sorted by price. It provides methods for inserting products, balancing the tree, and maintaining sorted order.

### `hashtable.py`
This file contains the **hash table** implementation used for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions based on the product ID. The hash table ensures efficient access to product data by using the ID as the key.

### `main.py`
The main driver code of the application, where the inventory management system is executed. This file initializes the inventory, performs the insert, delete, and retrieve operations, and interacts with the AVL tree and hash table.


### `utils.py`
Contains helper methods that are used by `main.py` to perform various operations such as validation, data processing, and utility functions needed throughout the app.

### `memory_test.py`
Contains the code for the memory test of the application.

### `regression_test.py`
Contains the code for the regression test of the application.

### `performance_test.py`
Contains the code for the performance test of the application.

### `requirements.txt`
A file listing the required dependencies for the project. It includes libraries and packages needed to run the system.

# Inventory Management System - Feature Documentation

### Core Data Structures
1. **Hash Table**
   - ID-based product lookup
   - O(1) time complexity for basic operations
   - Collision handling with chaining

2. **AVL Tree**
   - Price-based product organization
   - Self-balancing for optimal performance
   - O(log n) operations

### Basic Operations
1. Insert new products
2. Delete products
3. Search by ID
4. View inventory

## Enhanced Features
