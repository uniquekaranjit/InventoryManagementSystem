# Inventory Management System
**Version**: 2.0.0.PHASE2

## Overview
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage product inventories. The system provides functionalities to **insert**, **delete**, **retrieve**, and **sort** products, ensuring smooth operations for maintaining product data. The core logic of the system is built on two key data structures: an **AVL tree** and a **hash table**, both of which help optimize performance for fast lookups, insertions, deletions, and sorting.

The system supports the following features:
- **Insert**: Add new products to the inventory with details such as product ID, name, and price.
- **Delete**: Remove products from the inventory using a unique product ID.
- **Retrieve**: Retrieve product details based on a given product ID.
- **Sorting**: Products are automatically sorted based on price using an AVL tree.

## Project Structure

### `evidences/`
 A directory containing screenshots generated by the testing of the code. 


### `AVLTree.py`
Contains the implementation of the **AVL tree** data structure, which ensures that product data is sorted by price. It provides methods for inserting products, balancing the tree, and maintaining sorted order.

### `hashtable.py`
This file contains the **hash table** implementation used for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions based on the product ID. The hash table ensures efficient access to product data by using the ID as the key.

### `main.py`
The main driver code of the application, where the inventory management system is executed. This file initializes the inventory, performs the insert, delete, and retrieve operations, and interacts with the AVL tree and hash table.

### `requirements.txt`
A file listing the required dependencies for the project. It includes libraries and packages needed to run the system.

### `utils.py`
Contains helper methods that are used by `main.py` to perform various operations such as validation, data processing, and utility functions needed throughout the app.
